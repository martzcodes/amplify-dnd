# Amplify-DND

This was originally a submission for an [AWS Amplify + Hashnode hackathon](https://townhall.hashnode.com/announcing-aws-amplify-hackathon-on-hashnode)

The tileset used is from an artist on [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/underworld-load-comprehensive-top-view-rpg-tileset-32x32-some-16x24-16x16).  I picked it because I liked the perspective.

I also made use of svg icons from [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/) which I strongly recommend.

The app uses AWS Amplify, Tailwind CSS, and React (among other things).
